#### K16_SF09_0vap.csv and K16_SF09_20vap.csv

Surface pressure (bars) for a number of gases in equilibrium with a magma ocean as a function of surface temperature (K).


This data was generated as part of [Kite et al. (2016)](doi.org/10.3847/0004-637X/828/2/80) from the MAGMA model as presented in [Schaefer & Fegley (2009)](doi.org/10.1088/0004-637X/703/2/L113). The simulation evolves from an initial bulk silicate Earth magma composition assuming vapor is progressively lost from the atmosphere. 

Here, K16_SF09_0vap.csv and K16_SF09_20vap.csv are results for 0% fractional vaporization (i.e., bulk silicate Earth magma composition) and 20% fractional vaporization, respectively.
